#Vzzz

Vzzz is an _unofficial_ virtual copy of the [Mezzz controller by Sleepy Circuits](https://sleepycircuits.com/mezzz). Mezzz is the companion hardware unit to the VidOS video synthesizer, which runs as an app on iOS, iPad or MacOS. Using Vzzz, you can control VidOS using a mouse and keyboard, or map a MIDI controller to any of its many (many) parameters. The goal of the project is to replicate as much of the hardware functionality as possible, and keep it up to date as the VidOS app evolves.

To get around the DAW MIDI implementation quirks, Vzzz sends it's own MIDI, bypassing the host. Currently this is implemented in the most naive way possible, and those of you with more advanced MIDI setups will no doubt have some interesting problems which we'll figure out when we get there.

# Installation

Copy the .vst3 file to wherever your DAW looks for plugins.

# Getting Started

The interface closely mirrors the physical unit, so the excellent Sleepy Circuits [Mega Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGYH6aY2e7Y) will get you aquainted with the controls. Use the tab bar at the top to navigate between the different sections.
